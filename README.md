# OYO Hotel Booking Analysis
This repository contains solutions to Python and SQL interview questions commonly asked for Business Analyst roles at OYO. The datasets and questions are real-world inspired, focused on analyzing hotel bookings and revenues across cities and properties.

Repository Structure
- Jupyter notebooks with detailed Python data analysis and visualization solutions
- Peeyush_20250910.sql — SQL query solution file
- Sample datasets for practice and testing (provided in this repository)
- README.md — This documentation

## Python Solutions
Python analyses are implemented as Jupyter notebooks using Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib.

Key implemented tasks:

1. Calculate total revenue generated per city from hotel bookings dataset
2. Identify the city with highest month-over-month booking growth
3. Compute percentage cancellation rate for each property
4. Detect properties with unusually high cancellation rates using Z-score method
5. Plot a bar chart of top 5 cities by total revenue

Notebooks are modular, extensively commented, and designed for easy interactivity and exploration.

## SQL Solutions
The file sql/Peeyush_20250910.sql contains all SQL query solutions addressing:

1. Total revenue per city
2. Customers with more than 3 bookings in the last year
3. Cancellation rates per property
4. Month with highest city revenue
5. Properties with occupancy rates greater than 90%

These queries are designed for straightforward adaptation to most SQL database platforms.

## Datasets
Sample datasets are included in the repository
- Hotel booking CSV datasets for Python notebooks
- Assumed database tables supporting the SQL queries

## Setup and Usage

### Python 
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib notebook
```
- Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Run and explore the analysis interactively.

### SQL
